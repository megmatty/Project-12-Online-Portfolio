# Project-12-Online-Portfolio
Treehouse FEWD Project 12
----
This is my final project for Treehouse Techdegree: Front End Developer.

**Project Notes:**
* Validated HTML, CSS
* Custom domain name
* Attempted to hit exceeds criteria
  * Links 6 projects
  * Tablet breakpoints
  * SVGs for contact icons in footer
  * Multiple JS interactions

**Needs Work, Need to Learn, and Thoughts:**
* Design: Design is still tough for me but I developed the design by reviewing portfolios online and visiting sites like Behance. I 
  attempted to keep things simple and clean. I figure well executed simple is better than trying to go too fancy and failing.
* Javascript: I challenged myself here to implement object and constructor function concepts as I haven't had much practice with
  those and wanted a better understanding. I think it works well...however, it's on my to-do list for the future to update. I realize
  that for SEO and accessibility. programmatically generated content is not ideal. For the next iteration I will likely create the
  overlay content in HTML, hide it with CSS, and then write new code to grab the text from those places for the overlay. I also learned
  about the limits of window.innerwidth and outside/inside scroll bars. A mobile menu solely based on CSS media queries is also likely
  in my future.
* CSS: I pushed myself to use Sass here, which I haven't since project 5, and I was glad I did. It was easier to set up and less
  intimidating this time around. I still need to get more practice with mixins and extends, as I see am not really scratching the surface
  of Sass's power yet. Need to better address landscape media queries for mobile devices in the future, but I think it's servicable
  for now.
* Final thoughts: I have learned a ton in this program, and still have much more to learn! However, I have come away with a much better
  idea of how to structure projects myself, and the "process" of development. I want to learn much more about Javascript and am 
  contemplating my next learning step. I'm career changing, so I need to make sure my skills are as sharp as they can be so someone
  will give me a chance at that first dev job.

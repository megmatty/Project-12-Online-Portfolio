                   <h3>Hi, I'm Meg Matty, and I'm a Front End Web Developer.</h3>
                   <p>For several years I had been working as a clinical psychologist, until I took a job in our organization's IT department, consulting on technology project development. During that time I developed a strong interest in web and software development, and so over the last year I've dedicated myself to learning to code. I'm naturally curious and driven to learn, but probably my greatest strength is my resourcefulness - the ability to find information and adapt to meet the challenges of a problem. I have a strong work ethic and experience working with both onsite and remote teams. My personal motto is: "If I don't know it, I can learn it."</p>
                   
                   <p>When I'm not working or learning, you can find me running outdoors or playing video games on my PC.</p>

                   <h3 class="section-title">Skills and Training</h3>
                   <p>I'm a graduate of the Treehouse Front End Developer Techdegree, a 6 to 9-month intensive online program that required 24 courses, 12 real-world projects, and a proctored final exam. I have training and skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript & jQuery, Sass, and development tools like Github and Gulp. In addition, I have experience with project management, Agile/Scrum, user behavior, and more.</p>
